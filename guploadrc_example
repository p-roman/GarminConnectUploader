# Replace 'my_username' and 'my_pasword' below with your login credentials

# COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS BEING STORED IN A CLEAR TEXT 
# FILE.  Save this file as .guploadrc  (gupload.ini for Windows). 
# gupload.py first looks for this config file in the current working 
# directory, then your home directory (typicaly /home/<Linux_username> in
# Linux, or c:\Documents and Settings\<win_username> in Windows. gupload.py 
# prefers command line credentials first, then looks for a config file 
# in the current directory, then the user's home directory.
# Replace <username> and <password> below with your Garmin Connect 
# logging credentials.
# If you have many files stored in one directory and want to always upload
# from this directory, uncomment last 2 lines and replace <full_path_to_dir>
# with the full path to the directory containing FIT, TCX, or GPX files.
